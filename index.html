<a id="welcome-to-signalblocks" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-signal-blocks" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome</h3>

<p>You can get started as follows:</p>

<pre><code>$ git clone https://github.com/neeraj9/SignalBlocks.git
$ cd SignalBlocks
$ sh build-linux.sh
$ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local
$ make
</code></pre>

<p>The SignalBlocks is a c++ framework to implement blocks of
logic which can be tied together like digital signal processing
(DSP) blocks (as in Matlab). This toolset aims to be fast, adaptable
and free (GPLv3 license) for the student/research community.</p>

<p>Please note that this is a humble attempt (no way complete) to
give a framework which is (probably) useful to the scientific
community.</p>

<p>The c++ can appear daunting for newbies but I strive to make those
as simple possible in the future. Additionally, there are so many
opensource libraries available which I intend to reuse for much faster
development.</p>

<pre><code>I know that the sample code is a lot cryptic at present,
but I plan to change all that once I get free time.

<h3>
<a id="roadmap" class="anchor" href="#roadmap" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Roadmap</h3>

<ol>
<li>c++ blocks for a fast yet easy to use software modules for a
generic processing. The idea is to have a basic framework
which will use a lot of opensource libariries to present
a blockset for mathematical (and probably more).</li>
<li>graphical based approach where users will use blocks as
drag an drop, while the c++ engine is running in the
background (more like Matlab Simulink).</li>
<li>Have some more thoughts but none mature enough to state
yet.</li>
</ol>

<h3>
<a id="motivation" class="anchor" href="#motivation" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Motivation</h3>

<p>I was always facinated by Matlab power and ease of use while in
college and wanted to implement something similar but in a language
which can be compiled to native format for blazingly fast performance.
This project is an attempt to give a basic frameowork which will (soon)
encapsulate many of the open source software to construct a building
block for such requirement.</p>

<h3>
<a id="blocks" class="anchor" href="#blocks" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Blocks</h3>

<pre><code>(inspired from matlab-simulink)
blocks:

constant (source of constant number)
demux (one to many)
summation (add values received so far)
gain (multiply input with a constant factor)
logical AND (output is boolean type)
mux (many to one)
product (multiply x and y giving z as output)
relational operation (ex. &lt;= on inputs x,y and give boolean output)
saturation (with upper and lower limit)
sum (x+y = z)
switch (pass ip1 when ip2 satisfies some criteria (&gt;= threshold) else pass ip3 to op1)
terminator (dummy output port)
delay (with some initial condition which is the initial output till delay is reached for first output)
quantizer (quantization interval (ex. 0.5) is fixed at start and input is divided by that to get integer output)
wrap to zero (if the input &gt; threshold then output = 0, else output = input)
difference (have fixed initial condition, y(n) = x(n) - x(n-1)
buffer (convert serial data to a buffer of given size)
nbuffer (convert serial data to a buffer of length N where N is within a given set and repeats over and over) - TODO
serialize (convert buffer to serial data, or send one-by-one to the connected peer)
downsample (filter data to down-sample input stream of data)
upsample (filter data to up-sample the input stream and insert 0s) - TODO
</code></pre>

<h3>
<a id="todo" class="anchor" href="#todo" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>TODO</h3>

<ul>
<li>Make mutex optional, which will speedup single-threaded operations.
How about having a ifdef like DISABLE_MUTEX or something?</li>
<li>Enable Port vector operations</li>
<li>Think about removing the generic list operation (i.e. std::list)
in favour of vector</li>
<li>Include a bulk of Gnu Scientific Library vector operations</li>
<li>Enable Port matrix operations</li>
<li>Include matrix operations provided by GSL</li>
<li>Test all socket operations tcp, udp, udplite and sctp</li>
<li>Enhance bulk of functionality with unit tests</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a id="thanks" class="anchor" href="#thanks" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Thanks</h3>

<p>I have a lot of strategies to make this library even more useful to
students/researchers, while this is one humble attempt to go
one step closer towards the final goal.</p>

<p>Please write comments / send me an email since a lot needs to be
achieved and this is just the beginning.</p>
