Changes in version 0.11

  2006-05-11
	 - Implemented matrix-matrix multiplication to do deferred
	   evaluation, as suggested by Bjarne Stroustrup.
         - More documentation

Changes in version 0.9

  2006-04-29
	 - Added Chebyshev series approximation. 


  2006-04-26
	 - Made `matrix operator*(matrix,matrix)' be normal matrix
	   multiplication. 
	 - Made `vector operator*(matrix,vector)' be normal matrix
	   vector multiplication. 
	 - Defined a tentative `matrix operator/(matrix,matrix)'
	 - Added more decompositions.

Changes in version 0.5

  2004-05-24
	 - The complex<Type> class template specialisations now use a
 	   pointer to memory rather than a stack variable.  This is
	   because it allows us to do away with references to
	   temporaries in the vector and matrix class templates.  It
	   requires a bit of bookkeeping, and an extra data member in
	   the class, but I think that's a price worth paying.  An
	   alternative would be to use a sub-class which is
	   essentially the same.  The changes in user-land should be
	   minimal. 

  2004-05-18
	 - Initial efforts to support BLAS stuff.  Implemented as
	   functions. 
	 - vector<...> and matrix<...> now only take one template
	   parameter, which is fine. 

Changes in version 0.4

  2004-04-15
	 - Now implements Random Number Generators 
	 - Now implements Quasi Random Number Generators 
	 - Now implements Random Number Distributions
